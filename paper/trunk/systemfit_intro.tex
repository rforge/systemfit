\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many theoretical models consist of more than one equation. If these
models are econometrically estimated, it may not be appropriate to
estimate the equations individually, but all together, because the
disturbance terms of these equations are likely to be contemporaneously
correlated \citep{theil71} (make sure this is the correct paper).
Estimating all equations simultaneously, taking the
covariance structure of the residuals into account, leads to efficient
estimates.
Ignoring this correlation leads to an inefficient
parameter estimation \citep{zellner62}.

Another reason to estimate an equation system simultaneously are
cross-equation parameter restrictions. These restrictions can be
tested and/or imposed only in a simultaneous estimation
approach especially the economic theory suggests many cross-equation
restrictions \textbf{(is this statement really true?)}.

The \pkg{systemfit} package provides the capability to estimate
linear and non-linear equation systems in \proglang{R}.
Although linear and non-linear equation systems can be estimated
with several other statistical and econometric software packages
(e.g. \proglang{SAS}, \proglang{EViews}, \proglang{TSP}),
\pkg{systemfit} has several advantages.
First, all estimation procedures are publicly available in the source code.
Second, the estimation algorithms can be easily modified to meet specific
requirements.
Third, the (advanced) user can control many important details of the
estimation procedure that are generally not available in other software
packages.
On the other hand, these user options have reasonable defaults that also
beginners can easily use the provided functions.

This paper is organized as follows: In section~\ref{sec:Estimation} we
introduce the mathematics of estimating equation systems.
Section~\ref{sec:Restrictions} shows how linear restrictions can be
imposed.
Section~\ref{sec:Usage} demonstrates how to run
\pkg{systemfit}, especially how the features presented in the previous
sections can be used.
All other relevant issues are discussed in section~\ref{sec:Other}.
Finally, a summary and outlook are presented in
section~\ref{sec:Summmary}.
