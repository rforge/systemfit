\section{Introduction}

Many theoretical models consist of more than one equation. If these
models are econometrically estimated, the equations generally should
not be estimated individually, but all together, because the
disturbance terms of these equations are likely contemporaneously
correlated. Estimating all equations simultaneously and taking the
covariance structure of the residuals into account leads to efficient
estimates, while ignoring this correlation leads to an inefficient
parameter estimation \citep{zellner62}.

Another reason to estimate an equation system simultaneously are
cross-equation parameter restrictions. These restrictions can be
tested and/or imposed only in a simultaneous estimation
approach. Especially the economic theory suggests many cross-equation
restriction.

The \pkg{systemfit} package provides the capability to estimate
linear and non-linear equation systems in \proglang{R}. Compared to
other statistics and econometrics software the (advanced) user can
control many important details of the estimation procedure. On the
other hand these user options have reasonable defaults that also
beginners can easily use the provided functions.

\textbf{I'll have to update this section to match the recent changes. JDH.}

This paper is organized as follows: In section~\ref{sec:Estimation} we
introduce the mathematics of estimating equation systems.
Section~\ref{sec:Restrictions} shows how linear restrictions can be
imposed.
All other relevant issues are discussed in section~\ref{sec:Other}.
Section~\ref{sec:Usage} demonstrates how to run
\pkg{systemfit}, especially how the features presented in the previous
sections can be used.
Finally, a summary and an outlook are given in
section~\ref{sec:Summmary}.
