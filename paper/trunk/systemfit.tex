\Abstract{ 
Many statistical analyses are based on models containing systems of
structurally related equations.
In cases where cross-equation disturbances are correlated,
full information methods are required \citep{zellner62}.
If exogenous variables are stochastically dependent
on the disturbances in the system,
then instrumental variable estimation methods should be used
\citep{zellner62b}
The package \pkg{systemfit} provides the capability
to estimate systems of linear equations
within the \proglang{R} programming environment.
}

\Keywords{R, simultaneous equations systems,
  seemingly unrelated regression, two-stage least squares,
  three-stage least squares}
