%% an abstract and keywords
\Abstract{ 
Many statistical analyses are based on models containing systems of
structurally related equations.
Since in most cases cross-equation disturbances are correlated,
full information methods are required \citep{zellner62}.
If exogenous variables are stochastically dependent
on the disturbances in the system,
instrumental variable estimations should be used for parameter estimation
\citep{zellner62b}
The package \pkg{systemfit} provides the capability
to estimate systems of linear equations
within the \proglang{R} programming environment.
}

\Keywords{R, simultaneous equations systems,
  seemingly unrelated regression, two-stage least squares,
  three-stage least squares}

% checked out and updated local copy before edits

% Revision 1.13  2005/09/26 20:34:12  henningsena

% Revision 1.10  2005/09/01 11:49:02  henningsena
% moved section about non-linear estimation from systemfit.tex into new file nlsystemfit.tex, because this section should not be included in (this version of) the article

% Revision 1.9  2004/11/16 10:59:09  henningsena
% some minor changes and some comments on nlsystemfit

% Revision 1.8  2004/11/16 08:55:53  henningsena
% merged file and resolved conflict due to some minor changes I did while Jeff was adding nlsystemfit.

% Revision 1.7  2004/11/16 05:34:47  hamannj
% question about nlsystemfit code section (example)

% Revision 1.6  2004/11/16 05:32:46  hamannj
% made small changes because my code section wouldn't compile. argh.

% Revision 1.5  2004/11/16 05:31:19  hamannj
% added cvs header and log section. to be removed when submitted.
