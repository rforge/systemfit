%% an abstract and keywords
\Abstract{ Many statistical analysis are based on models that consist
  of  more than one equation.  These equations should be fitted
  simultaneously rather than equation  by equation.  The package
  \pkg{systemfit} provides the capability to estimate systems  of
  linear and non-linear equations in \proglang{R}.
} 
  
\Keywords{R, simultaneous equation system, seemingly unrelated regression}

$Log$
Revision 1.11  2005/09/01 12:27:55  henningsena
revised structure of the document (sections, subsections, subsubsections) due to removal of nlsystemfit; moved each section into a separate file.

Revision 1.10  2005/09/01 11:49:02  henningsena
moved section about non-linear estimation from systemfit.tex into new file nlsystemfit.tex, because this section should not be included in (this version of) the article

Revision 1.9  2004/11/16 10:59:09  henningsena
some minor changes and some comments on nlsystemfit

Revision 1.8  2004/11/16 08:55:53  henningsena
merged file and resolved conflict due to some minor changes I did while Jeff was adding nlsystemfit.

Revision 1.7  2004/11/16 05:34:47  hamannj
question about nlsystemfit code section (example)

Revision 1.6  2004/11/16 05:32:46  hamannj
made small changes because my code section wouldn't compile. argh.

Revision 1.5  2004/11/16 05:31:19  hamannj
