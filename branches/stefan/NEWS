THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "systemfit" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-4

* model.matrix.systemfit.equation() now returns a matrix (and not a vector)
  even if the equation has only one regressor (including the constant);
  this fixes bugs in model.matrix.systemfit() and predict.systemfit()
  that occured if (at least) one equation has only one regressor


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-2

* the subfolder "tests" and the test scripts in this subfolder are no longer
  included in the R package in order to reduce the time for checking
  this package on CRAN


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-0

* added a NAMESPACE file

* the returned fitted values, residuals, and the model frame include *all*
  observations now, where fitted values and residuals of observation
  that were not included in the estimation are NA

* systemfit can estimate systems of equations with unequal numbers
  of observations now


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-4

* added our JSS paper about systemfit as a vignette


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-0 AND BEFORE

* please take a look at the log messages of the SVN repository on R-Forge
